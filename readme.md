#Goldilocks Approach.sass
A good starting point for responsive web design that takes device resolution out of the equation

##How does it work?
The Goldilocks Approach uses a combination of Ems, Max-Width, Media Queries and Pattern Translations to consider just three states that allow your designs to be resolution independent. Check out the example.html page included to see how it works.

##What's up with .sass?
While The Goldilocks Approach as written in CSS is pretty cool, I intend to make it even cooler using Sass/Compass to add that extra special somethin somethin!

##It contains
*2 well commented CSS files that consider 3 CSS Media Query increments; multi column, narrow column and single column
*Good typographic defaults out of the box (including print contexts)
*A boilerplate HTML file to get you started (index.html)

##What's the roadmap for Goldilocks Approach => Goldilocks Approach.sass?
*Convert all vanilla CSS to Sass
*Install Compass for some instant on Sass Awesome
*Install Sinatra for bootstrap server environment 
*Probably convert template environment to Slim cause it rocks
